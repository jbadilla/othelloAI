INSTRUCTIONS
============

1.) Run the debug server with node.
2.) Open the board.html page on a browser (we'll probably use Chrome).
3.) Click on any free cell.
4.) The terminal running the debug server will output debug messages showing the interaction
between the client and the server, and the information being exchanged.
5.) The html page will update the board according to the gamestates being received.
